üìå Objective

To build a simple Python web scraper that automatically collects the top news headlines from a public news website and saves them into a text file.

üß† Description

This project uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to:

Fetch the HTML content of a news website.

Parse and extract the main headlines ("<h2>" tags).


Save those headlines into a .txt file for later reading.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

Python 3

requests (for fetching webpage data)

BeautifulSoup (for parsing HTML)

VS Code (IDE used for coding and testing)
1.Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # for Windows


2.Install dependencies:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4


3.Run the Python script:

python news_scraper.py


4.Check the output:

A file named headlines.txt will be created in your folder.

It contains all scraped headlines.
Interview Questions:
1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a GET request?

A GET request is an HTTP method used to fetch data from a server (like a webpage).
Example: when you open a website, your browser sends a GET request to get that page‚Äôs content.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you install external packages in Python?

You use the pip command in the terminal.
Example:

pip install requests

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is a User-Agent in HTTP?

A User-Agent is a small text string sent by your browser (or program) that tells the website who is requesting the page ‚Äî for example, Chrome, Firefox, or a Python script.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is soup.find_all() used for?

find_all() is a BeautifulSoup method used to find all HTML elements that match a tag or condition.
Example:

soup.find_all('h2')  # finds all <h2> tags

5Ô∏è‚É£ What are the risks of web scraping?

You might violate a website‚Äôs terms of service.

Too many requests can overload the server.

Legal issues if data is copyrighted or private.

Website structure changes can break your scraper.

6Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between id and class in HTML?
Attribute	Purpose	Usage
id	Unique identifier for one element	Used only once per page
class	Used for grouping multiple elements	Can be used many times

Example:

<p id="intro">...</p>
<p class="news">...</p>

7Ô∏è‚É£ What is an HTML tag?

An HTML tag is a code element that tells the browser how to display content.
Example:

<h1>Headline</h1>


Here, <h1> is the tag and ‚ÄúHeadline‚Äù is the content.

8Ô∏è‚É£ What does .text return in BeautifulSoup?

.text returns the visible text content inside an HTML element ‚Äî removing all HTML tags.
Example:

headline.text  # gives only the text, not <h2> tags

9Ô∏è‚É£ What is a try-except block?

A try-except block is used to handle errors in Python.
Example:

try:
    print(10/0)
except:
    print("Error occurred")


It prevents the program from crashing when errors happen.

üîü What are HTTP status codes?

HTTP status codes are numbers returned by a web server to show the result of a request.

Code	Meaning
200	OK (Success)
404	Page not found
500	Server error
403	Forbidden
301	Redirected
